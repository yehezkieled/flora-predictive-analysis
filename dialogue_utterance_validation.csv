1132,2024-03-31 04:09:42.939,Student,"This is my draft proposal, can u give some feedback for improved?:Project Description The report proposes a data science project titled ‘Utilizing Twitter Data and Google Trends Data for Suicide Volume Forecasting’. This project’s main objective is to develop a predictive model leveraging the vast amount of unstructured data available on social media platforms like Twitter and search engine trends from Google to forecast the volume of suicide-related incidents. Bokolo and Liu (2023) demonstrates the effectiveness of such machine learning models in leveraging social media data for mental health analysis. The project also aims to extract actionable insights from data analysis to guide the development of targeted suicide prevention strategies.    Recent studies have highlighted concerning trends in mental health and suicide rates. Hedegaard et al. (2020) reported that over the last twenty years, there has been an upward trend in the age-adjusted suicide rate in the United States. This situation has been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to Kim et al. (2022), there was a significant increase in suicide cases among adolescents and adults in the immediate aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic's emergence.  This alarming escalation in suicide rates presents a critical challenge that demands immediate attention and action. It underscores the urgent need for increased focus and proactive measures to address the declining mental health conditions of the younger population and to implement effective loss prevention strategies.   This project involves several distinct data science roles, each with specific responsibilities. It begins with the Data Collector, who is responsible for gathering and pre-cleaning Twitter and Google data and ensuring it's free of duplicates and irrelevant information while adhering to privacy and ethical standards. Next, the Data Analyst examines the pre-cleaned data to find patterns and insights, using exploratory data analysis and data visualisation to highlight key findings for stakeholders. The Machine Learning Engineer then takes over, selecting appropriate algorithms, training the predictive model, and optimising its performance for accuracy. They also oversee the model's deployment, ensuring it operates efficiently in real-time and adjusting as necessary based on performance data.       Business Model This project sits in the intersection of mental health care and social media analytics. It has the potential to bring substantial benefits by utilising the power of data to address a critical public health issue. The rise of social media as a space for expressing mental distress and suicidal thoughts has made it a key tool for suicidal ideation detection, according to Morese et al., 2022, which is useful to suicide prevention. Mental health organisations, public health officials, and most importantly, individuals at risk could benefit significantly from the insights generated. This capability allows for a more targeted allocation of resources and the implementation of preventative measures that could save lives.   However, this project faces several significant challenges that are crucial to its success and ethical execution. Foremost among these is the imperative to ensure the privacy and anonymity of Twitter users, for the sensitive nature of the data involved. Social media data, while rich in insights, is inherently noisy and biassed, presenting obstacles in extracting reliable signals from the vast amounts of information. This noise and bias require sophisticated filtering and integrated techniques to ensure the data's relevance and accuracy (Azad et al., 2023). Additionally, the development of a robust predictive model hinges on access to a large volume of data. Such a model must be trained on diverse datasets to accurately forecast suicide volumes, necessitating not only vast amounts of data but also data that is representative and free of biases that could skew predictions. Addressing these challenges is essential for the project to fulfill its potential as a tool for suicide prevention, demanding a careful balance between innovation and ethical responsibility."

1155,2024-03-12 11:16:39.862,Student,"can you summarize this using bullet points?Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. have become an integral part of our lives. These platforms generate enormous amounts of data on a daily basis – data about users, their interests, behaviors, social connections, content created and interactions. This is where data science comes into the picture. Data science techniques help social media companies to derive insights from this data to improve user experience, target advertising, recommend content, and more. In this article, we will discuss the impact of data science on social media.  Identifying Usage Patterns Data science helps identify usage patterns – when users are more active, what content they usually interact with at different times of day, which features they use more often, etc. Social media platforms use this to optimize system performance for anticipated traffic volumes and tweak features for greater adoption.   Sentiment Analysis Sentiment analysis examines social text to determine emotional tone – whether users are expressing positive, negative or neutral sentiments. This provides insights into how users feel about certain topics, features or campaigns on social media. Platforms accordingly improve communication, product features or support system.  Detecting Virality Data science builds models to predict which content is likely to get shared rapidly and widely on social networks. These models take into account factors like messaging, imagery, emotions evoked, author’s profile, current trends and more. Platforms use such virality predictions to promote organic reach for branded content.  Customized Content Feeds & Ads Sophisticated algorithms analyze every bit of user activity – likes, shares, clicks, searches, purchases – to determine their interests and preferences. They then curate and recommend hyper-relevant organic posts, paid ads, suggested profiles and groups to follow. This creates a personalized experience.  Lookalike Modeling Platforms determine similarities across users to categorize them into custom-audiences or lookalike-audiences. They particularly target ads to people predicted to resemble existing users who already have shown a liking for those products – thereby boosting advertising ROI.  Community Insights Data science provides macro trends about topics being discussed in social communities over time. Network analysis identifies influential members based on how they connect communities. These insights help brands in community outreach programs. Chatbots are also trained on community conversations to automate engagement at scale."

Project Description 1.1. Introduction Spam emails, which are unsolicited bulk messages often related to phishing, scams, or advertising, significantly compromise user privacy and security (Aslan, Ö., Aktuğ, S. S., Ozkan-Okay, M., Yilmaz, A. A., & Akin, E., 2023). This project addresses the challenge of dataset imbalance and focuses on improving email spam detection efficiency through a dual approach involving resampling and ensemble learning techniques as suggested by Qi et al. (2023). However, Unlike Qi et al. (2023), my proposed model adopts a different resampling technique and models.  The dataset from Kaggle, with 5,158 records split into email content and spam/non-spam labels, shows an unequal distribution between the labels, as illustrated in the figure below.  Figure 1. Biased dataset towards the ""non-spam"".  1.2. Objective The goal is to boost the accuracy of spam detection models by mitigating dataset imbalance and using ensemble learning.

Introduction Spam emails, which are unsolicited bulk messages often related to phishing, scams, or advertising, significantly compromise user privacy and security (Aslan, Ö., Aktuğ, S. S., Ozkan-Okay, M., Yilmaz, A. A., & Akin, E., 2023). This project addresses the challenge of dataset imbalance and focuses on improving email spam detection efficiency through a dual approach involving resampling and ensemble learning techniques as suggested by Qi et al. (2023). However, Unlike Qi et al. (2023), my proposed model adopts a different resampling technique and models.  The Kaggle dataset, comprising 5,158 entries categorized into email content and spam/non-spam labels, demonstrates a label imbalance, with spam accounting for only 13% of the data, as shown in the figure below.  Figure 1. Biased dataset towards the ""non-spam"".  1.2. Objective The goal is to boost the accuracy of spam detection models by mitigating dataset imbalance and using ensemble learning. The project will assess different resampling methods (random undersampling, SMOTE, bootstrapping) to even out the dataset and combine Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression via majority voting. Model success will be gauged by accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores in identifying spam emails. 1.3.

These algorithms are designed to make trades at high speeds and volumes that would be impossible for a human trader. The algorithms are based on pre-set rules such as timing, price, or volume. The goal of algorithmic trading is to increase efficiency, reduce human error, and improve the speed and accuracy of trading.<br><br>On the other hand, real-time stock market insights refer to the analysis of live data from the stock market. This can include a wide range of information, such as current stock prices, trading volumes, market trends, and more. These insights are often used to inform trading decisions, whether they are made by humans or algorithms.<br><br>The connection between these two concepts is that real-time stock market insights can be used to inform the design and execution of algorithmic trading strategies. For example, an algorithm might be programmed to automatically buy a certain stock when its price drops below a certain level. This decision would be based on real-time insights about the stock's current price and recent price trends.<br><br>In summary, algorithmic trading and real-time stock market insights are both crucial tools in modern finance. Algorithmic trading uses automated processes to execute trades, while real-time insights provide the data that informs these trades.
